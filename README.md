## Introduction
Demonstration on how to create an games using unity that change its state by connecting to an real data feed using REST API.
The data consist of weather data from https://www.weatherapi.com and the game will frequently updated to change its state.
This technique can be used to create level 2 digital twin  that has an added layer of operational and sensory data. 
The twin captures and aggregates defined data and verifies data to make sure that systems work together. (https://www.autodesk.com/design-make/articles/what-is-a-digital-twin)
